CoreSystem.Cache is a distributed caching framework for .NET 8.

It provides a unified cache API with Cache-Aside support, HTTP response caching, resilience, fallback storage, health checks, and OpenTelemetry metrics.

The framework is built around a pipeline architecture that separates cache operations from storage providers and cross-cutting behaviors.

## 📦 Companion packages

| Package | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| **CoreSystem.Memory** | In-memory cache provider |
| **CoreSystem.Serialization** | JSON, MessagePack, and Protocol Buffers serialization |
| **CoreSystem.Http** | HTTP abstractions used by the middleware |
| **CoreSystem.Observability** *(Optional)* | Ready-to-use OpenTelemetry instrumentation, metrics, tracing, and diagnostics for compatible packages |
| **CoreSystem.Observability.Abstractions** | Shared observability contracts for implementing custom instrumentation and integrations |


> Installing **CoreSystem.Cache** automatically installs the required provider and serialization packages through NuGet dependencies.

> **Optional:** Install **CoreSystem.Observability** to enable built-in OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing. Install **CoreSystem.Observability.Abstractions** only if you need to build custom observability components or integrations.

> **CoreSystem.Cache** can operate with the in-memory provider without requiring an external cache provider.

> When an external provider such as Redis is configured, companion packages can provide Redis storage, resilience, and cache rehydration capabilities.
