# Why CoreSystem.Cache?

`IDistributedCache` is an excellent abstraction for storing and retrieving data from distributed cache providers. It provides a simple, provider-agnostic API that works well for many applications.

As distributed systems evolve, however, caching becomes more than storing and retrieving key/value pairs. Production applications can require resilience, observability, serialization, HTTP response caching, cache invalidation, distributed locking, and operational insights.

Implementing these capabilities independently around `IDistributedCache` can result in duplicated infrastructure code and inconsistent behavior across applications.

CoreSystem.Cache provides a unified caching platform that orchestrates these concerns while allowing applications to remain focused on business logic.

## The Problem

Modern distributed applications may require capabilities such as:

- Automatic failover when an external cache provider becomes unavailable.
- Cache recovery after connectivity is restored.
- Cache invalidation by logical groups.
- Distributed locking to prevent cache stampede.
- Consistent serialization across cache providers.
- HTTP response caching.
- OpenTelemetry metrics.
- Health monitoring.
- Extensibility without modifying application code.

These capabilities are not provided by a single basic cache abstraction. Teams can therefore end up building custom infrastructure around `IDistributedCache`.

## The Solution

CoreSystem.Cache acts as the orchestration layer of the CoreSystem caching ecosystem.

Cache operations flow through a configurable execution pipeline before reaching the selected storage provider. Cross-cutting concerns such as logging, metrics, resilience, and fallback can therefore be applied without placing that logic inside application services or storage implementations.

The framework can operate with its in-memory provider without requiring an external cache provider. When an external provider is configured, companion packages can extend it with Redis storage, resilience, and cache rehydration capabilities.

## Benefits

Using CoreSystem.Cache provides several advantages:

- Unified caching API across providers.
- Separation of business logic from infrastructure concerns.
- Cache-Aside support through `GetOrAddAsync`.
- Tag-based cache invalidation.
- Resilience and fallback support for external storage.
- Built-in observability and diagnostics.
- HTTP response caching support.
- Extensible execution pipeline.
- In-memory caching without requiring an external provider.

## When Should You Use CoreSystem.Cache?

CoreSystem.Cache is useful for applications that require more than basic key/value caching, including:

- High-performance APIs.
- Distributed systems.
- Microservices.
- Cloud-native applications.
- HTTP response caching.
- External cache providers such as Redis.
- Cache invalidation by logical groups.
- OpenTelemetry integration.
- Provider-independent caching.
- Resilience around external cache providers.

If your application only requires basic distributed key/value storage, the built-in `IDistributedCache` abstraction may be sufficient.

CoreSystem.Cache is designed for applications that need a unified caching API and additional caching capabilities that can be composed around the core cache pipeline.
