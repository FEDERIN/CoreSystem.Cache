`CoreSystem.Cache.Rehydration` restores cache entries that were temporarily
stored in the memory fallback after the primary cache provider becomes healthy
again.

The package is designed to work with `CoreSystem.Cache` and an external primary
cache provider.

## 📦 Companion packages

| Package | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| **CoreSystem.Cache** | Cache orchestration and in-memory fallback |

`CoreSystem.Cache.Rehydration` does not implement a cache provider.

It reads tracked entries from the memory fallback and writes them to the
`ICacheStorageResolver.Primary` storage while preserving remaining expiration
and tags.

An external cache provider must be registered before rehydration is enabled.
