# 🗺️ Roadmap

This document outlines the planned evolution of **CoreSystem.Cache**.

The roadmap is intended to provide visibility into the long-term direction of the project. Features may evolve based on community feedback and real-world adoption.

---

## Guiding Principles

The framework will continue to evolve following these principles:

- Production-first
- Cloud-native
- Provider-independent
- Extensible architecture
- OpenTelemetry-first
- Backward compatibility whenever possible

---

## ✅ Completed

The following capabilities are already available in the current project.

### Core Infrastructure

- [x] Memory cache provider
- [x] Provider abstraction
- [x] Dependency Injection integration

---

### Cache Pipeline

- [x] Composable execution pipeline
- [x] Logging behavior
- [x] Metrics behavior
- [x] Resilience behavior
- [x] Fallback behavior

---

### Caching Features

- [x] Cache Aside pattern (`GetOrAddAsync`)
- [x] Tag-based invalidation
- [x] Concurrent cache population protection
- [x] HTTP response caching

---

### Serialization

- [x] JSON
- [x] MessagePack
- [x] Protocol Buffers

Serialization is selected through `CacheOptions.SerializerType` and delegated to the configured serialization package.

---

### Observability

- [x] OpenTelemetry Metrics
- [ ] Health Checks

---

## 🚧 Short-Term

The next releases will focus on improving flexibility and performance.

### Pipeline

- [x] Configurable pipeline ordering
- [x] Conditional behaviors
- [ ] Custom behavior registration

---

### Performance

- [ ] Compression behavior
- [ ] Benchmark suite
- [ ] Additional performance metrics

---

### Developer Experience

- [ ] More samples
- [ ] Extended documentation
- [ ] Analyzer package
- [ ] Source Link support

---

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision

Future versions aim to transform the framework into a complete caching platform.

### Multi-Level Cache

- [ ] L1 Cache
- [ ] L2 Cache
- [ ] Transparent synchronization

---

### Provider SDK

- [ ] Public provider SDK
- [ ] Storage provider templates
- [ ] Community provider support

---

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Adaptive expiration
- [ ] Cache analytics
- [ ] Native AOT optimizations
- [ ] Source Generator support

---

## 💡 Future Pipeline Behaviors

The pipeline architecture makes it possible to introduce additional behaviors without modifying existing cache operations.

Possible future behaviors include:

- [ ] CompressionBehavior
- [ ] EncryptionBehavior
- [ ] TracingBehavior
- [ ] AuditBehavior
- [ ] ValidationBehavior
- [ ] RateLimitingBehavior
- [ ] CacheWarmupBehavior
- [ ] CacheReplicationBehavior

---

## Community Ideas

Ideas proposed by the community may be incorporated into future releases.

Suggestions are welcome through:

- GitHub Issues
- GitHub Discussions
- Pull Requests

---

## Release Strategy

The project follows Semantic Versioning.

| Version | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| 1.x | Stability, bug fixes, documentation |
| 2.x | Extensibility and advanced pipeline capabilities |
| 3.x | Advanced caching strategies |
| 4.x | Ecosystem integration |
